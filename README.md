### C++ Programming Patterns  

These modern C++ examples are meant to serve as examples for me to reference when using the language. With ~75% of my work being in the Python ecosystem, and my fun programming being in C (solving Project Euler problems mostly), I get confused when I switch back to C++. I hope that when I need it, looking at these examples will quickly get my head back into the C++ world. Most of the examples will be simply using parts of the vast STL. I hope that you will find this collection useful too.    

#### Random Numbers
1. [Vectors of randomly generated ints](src/vec\_rand\_ints.cpp)  
2. [Vectors of randomly generated floats](src/vec\_rand\_floats.cpp)


#### Vectors and the \<algorithms\> library in C++ STL  
1. [Part 1. Misc.](src/vector\_STL\_algorithms.cpp)
2. [Part 2. Sorting](src/vec\_sorting.cpp)


#### \<unordered_map\> and its uses  
1. [Basic unordered_map examples](src/unordered\_map.cpp)  
2. [Find word frequencies using unordered_map](src/umap\_count\_freq.cpp)
